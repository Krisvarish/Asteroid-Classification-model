# ☄️ Asteroid Classification

This project predicts whether an asteroid is **hazardous** or **non-hazardous** using NASA's Near-Earth Object dataset.  
By applying machine learning techniques on features such as size, velocity, and orbital parameters, the model helps identify potentially dangerous asteroids.
