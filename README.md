### Dataset Overview

The `nasa.csv` file contains comprehensive asteroid data with features such as:
- **Orbital Characteristics**: Semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination
- **Physical Properties**: Estimated diameter, absolute magnitude
- **Proximity Metrics**: Minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID)
- **Classification Labels**: Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA) status

## üß† Machine Learning Approach

- **Gradient Boosting**: Advanced boosting techniques for high accuracy
- **Extra Trees**: Randomized decision trees for improved generalization
- **Support Vector Machine**: Effective for high-dimensional feature spaces
- **XGBoost**: State-of-the-art gradient boosting framework

### Feature Engineering

The system removes non-predictive features like "Id" and "Name" columns as they "do not play a role in determining the risk of asteroids hitting the Earth" and focuses on:

- **Orbital Parameters**: Semi-major axis, eccentricity, orbital period
- **Physical Characteristics**: Absolute magnitude, estimated diameter
- **Earth Proximity**: Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID)
- **Velocity Metrics**: Relative velocity at closest approach

### Model Training Process

```python
# Example workflow
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load NASA asteroid data
data = pd.read_csv('nasa.csv')

# Feature selection and preprocessing
features = ['absolute_magnitude', 'est_dia_in_km_min', 'relative_velocity', 'miss_dist_astronomical']
X = data[features]
y = data['hazardous']

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model training
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluation
predictions = rf_model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
```

## üìä Model Performance

## üî¨ Scientific Background

Current research focuses on training "multiple machine learning models on physical and orbital asteroid features" to "identify the model that most accurately classified the asteroids as hazardous or non-hazardous". This approach represents a significant advancement over traditional methods.

Advanced techniques include using "machine learning techniques to predict the orbital parameters of asteroids" with "SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm to identify potentially dangerous subgroups of asteroids that are found in major NEAs groups".

## üìà Dataset Analysis

### NASA Asteroid Database Features

The dataset includes comprehensive information about Near-Earth Objects:

```python
# Key features for classification
orbital_features = [
    'semi_major_axis',
    'eccentricity', 
    'orbital_inclination',
    'orbital_period'
]

physical_features = [
    'absolute_magnitude',
    'estimated_diameter_min',
    'estimated_diameter_max'
]

proximity_features = [
    'relative_velocity',
